## React Social Network

Social Network Single Page Application (SPA) on React.js

The app uses Redux, redux-thunk middleware, axios requests and auth on side API (not made by me), react-router for navigation,uses redux-form forms validation, etc.

Intentionally made without class components (using Hooks). 

Build deployed on: https://kexxpert.online/social

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
